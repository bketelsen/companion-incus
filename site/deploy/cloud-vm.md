title: Deploy on a Cloud VM

# Deploy on a Cloud VM

Companion Incus runs locally by default, but you can deploy it on a remote server for always-on access, shared team usage, or dedicated development environments with Incus containers.

## Choosing a setup

| Scenario | Recommended approach |
|---|---|
| Solo developer, single machine | [Local install](/get-started/installation) with `bunx companion-incus` |
| Always-on server in the cloud | Cloud VM with Tailscale (this guide) |
| Isolated per-project environments | [Incus environments](/guides/incus-environments) on any host |
| Team sharing a single instance | Remote deploy with Tailscale ACLs for access control |

::: tip
You can combine approaches — deploy on a GCP VM and use Incus containers within it for per-project isolation.
:::

## Architecture

Regardless of where you deploy, the architecture stays the same:

1. The Companion Incus server runs on the host (port 3456 by default)
2. It spawns Claude Code or Codex CLI processes as child subprocesses
3. Your browser connects to the server over WebSocket
4. A reverse proxy or tunnel (like Tailscale) provides secure remote access

The server is stateless enough to restart cleanly — sessions persist to disk and CLI processes reconnect automatically. See [Session Recovery](/guides/sessions-and-permissions#session-recovery) for details.

## GCP Virtual Machine

This guide walks you through deploying Companion Incus on a private GCP VM in the `europe-west9` (Paris) region. The VM has no public IP — you'll access it securely through Tailscale, which gives you an HTTPS endpoint without exposing anything to the internet.

By the end, you'll have a dedicated Companion Incus server running at `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/`.

### What you'll set up

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| GCP Compute Engine VM | Runs Companion Incus (no public IP) |
| IAP tunnel | SSH access to the private VM |
| Cloud NAT | Outbound internet for package installs |
| Tailscale | Secure access via your private network |

### Prerequisites

- **gcloud CLI** installed and authenticated (`gcloud auth login`)
- An active **GCP project** with billing enabled
- Permissions for **Compute Engine**, **IAP**, **Network** (Router/NAT), and **Service Usage**
- A **Tailscale account** with an [auth key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) ready
- A **Claude Code** or **Codex** API key for the agent CLI
- **Incus** will be installed on the VM (no separate installation needed on your local machine)

### 1. Set your variables

Define these once — every command below references them.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export ZONE="europe-west9-a"              # Paris
export REGION="europe-west9"
export INSTANCE="companion-incus-vm"
export MACHINE_TYPE="e2-standard-4"       # 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM
export IMAGE_FAMILY="ubuntu-2404-lts-amd64"
export IMAGE_PROJECT="ubuntu-os-cloud"
export DISK_SIZE="50GB"
export DISK_TYPE="pd-ssd"
export NETWORK="default"
export ROUTER_NAME="nat-router-ew9"
export NAT_NAME="nat-config-ew9"
export COMPANION_HOSTNAME="companion"
export TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY="tskey-auth-REPLACE_ME"
```

::: warning
Never commit `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` to version control. Revoke and regenerate it after automated provisioning.
:::

### 2. Create the VM

Spin up an Ubuntu 24.04 instance with no public IP address.

```bash
gcloud compute instances create "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --image-family="$IMAGE_FAMILY" \
  --image-project="$IMAGE_PROJECT" \
  --machine-type="$MACHINE_TYPE" \
  --boot-disk-size="$DISK_SIZE" \
  --boot-disk-type="$DISK_TYPE" \
  --no-address \
  --scopes=cloud-platform \
  --tags=companion
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
gcloud compute instances describe "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --format="get(status,networkInterfaces[0].networkIP)"
```

You should see `RUNNING` and an internal IP like `10.x.x.x`.

### 3. Enable IAP for SSH

Since the VM has no public IP, you'll SSH through Google's Identity-Aware Proxy.

```bash
gcloud services enable iap.googleapis.com --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

Test the connection:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap
```

::: tip
If you get a `SERVICE_DISABLED` error, wait a minute after enabling the IAP API — it can take a moment to propagate.
:::

### 4. Set up Cloud NAT

The VM needs outbound internet access to download packages and install toolchains.

Create the router:

```bash
gcloud compute routers create "$ROUTER_NAME" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --network="$NETWORK" \
  --region="$REGION"
```

Attach a NAT configuration:

```bash
gcloud compute routers nats create "$NAT_NAME" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --router="$ROUTER_NAME" \
  --router-region="$REGION" \
  --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges \
  --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips
```

### 5. Provision the VM

This script installs system packages, Incus, Node.js, and the development toolchain. Save it locally as `provision-devbox.sh`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "=== Provisioning started ==="

# --- System packages ---
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  curl git build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev \
  zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libyaml-dev jq tmux unzip

# --- Incus ---
# Add the Zabbly stable PPA (recommended for up-to-date Incus packages)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkgs.zabbly.com/key.asc -o /etc/apt/keyrings/zabbly.asc
sudo sh -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zabbly-incus-stable.sources
Enabled: yes
Types: deb
URIs: https://pkgs.zabbly.com/incus/stable
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo ${VERSION_CODENAME})
Components: main
Architectures: $(dpkg --print-architecture)
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/zabbly.asc
EOF'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y incus
sudo incus admin init --minimal
sudo usermod -aG incus-admin "$USER"

# --- Node.js 22 ---
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# --- Claude Code CLI ---
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# --- GitHub CLI ---
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main' \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list >/dev/null
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gh

# --- Postgres + Redis clients (optional) ---
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client-16 redis-tools

echo "=== Provisioning complete ==="
```

Run it on the VM:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --command 'bash -s' < ./provision-devbox.sh
```

### 6. Install Bun and Companion Incus

SSH into the VM and install Companion Incus as a global package with a background service:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --command 'bash -lc "
set -euo pipefail

# Install Bun
if ! command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
fi
export PATH=\$HOME/.bun/bin:\$PATH

# Install Companion Incus globally
bun install -g companion-incus

# Register as a systemd service and start
companion-incus install
companion-incus start
"'
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --command 'bash -lc "
export PATH=\$HOME/.bun/bin:\$PATH
companion-incus status
"'
```

### 7. Connect with Tailscale

Tailscale creates a secure mesh network between your devices.

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap \
  --command "bash -lc '
set -euo pipefail

# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Join your tailnet (auth key passed via env var to avoid process-table exposure)
export TS_AUTHKEY=\"$TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY\"
sudo -E tailscale up \
  --hostname=\"$COMPANION_HOSTNAME\" \
  --ssh
unset TS_AUTHKEY

# Serve Companion Incus over HTTPS
sudo tailscale serve --bg 3456
'"
```

Once connected, open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/
```

Replace `<hostname>` with the value of `COMPANION_HOSTNAME` and `<tailnet>` with your Tailscale network name.

::: tip
Run `sudo tailscale status` on the VM to see the full hostname and confirm the node is connected.

## Day-to-day operations

### Companion commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `companion-incus status` | Check if the service is running |
| `companion-incus logs` | Tail recent logs |
| `companion-incus restart` | Restart the server |
| `companion-incus stop` | Stop the server |

### Tailscale commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sudo tailscale status` | Show connection status and IP |
| `sudo tailscale serve status` | Check the HTTPS proxy configuration |
| `sudo tailscale serve --https=443 off` | Disable the HTTPS proxy |

### SSH into the VM

```bash
gcloud compute ssh "$INSTANCE" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID" \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --tunnel-through-iap
```

## Troubleshooting

### `apt` commands time out

The VM has no public IP, so outbound traffic depends on Cloud NAT. Verify the router and NAT are in the **same region** as the VM:

```bash
gcloud compute routers nats describe "$NAT_NAME" \
  --router="$ROUTER_NAME" \
  --router-region="$REGION" \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

### IAP SSH fails with `SERVICE_DISABLED`

Enable the IAP API and wait a minute for propagation:

```bash
gcloud services enable iap.googleapis.com --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

Also check that your GCP user has the **IAP-Secured Tunnel User** role.

### `bun install` fails with "unzip is required"

The provisioning script installs `unzip`, but if you skipped it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y unzip
```

### Tailscale node not visible

- Check that the auth key hasn't expired — generate a new one from the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
- Verify the node is connected: `sudo tailscale status`
- Make sure your local device is also on the same tailnet

### Companion Incus UI loads but sessions fail

- Confirm the Claude Code CLI is authenticated: SSH in and run `claude` once
- Check that your API key or subscription is valid
- Review server logs: `companion-incus logs`

### Incus containers fail to launch

- Verify Incus is running: `sudo systemctl status incus`
- Check your user is in the `incus-admin` group: `groups`
- Make sure the Companion Incus image has been built: visit the Environments page in the UI or run `incus image list` to check for the `companion-incus` alias

## Security considerations

- The VM has **no public IP** — it's only reachable via IAP (SSH) and Tailscale (HTTPS)
- **Revoke and regenerate** the Tailscale auth key after provisioning
- Use [Tailscale ACLs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls) to restrict which devices and users can reach the VM
- Companion Incus generates an auth token automatically — see [Authentication](/get-started/installation#authentication) for details
- Consider enabling GCP [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access) for centralized SSH access control
- Clear shell history after provisioning to remove any sensitive values: `history -c && history -w`
- The Incus daemon socket (`/var/lib/incus/unix.socket`) is restricted to the `incus-admin` group. Only users in that group can manage containers.

::: info
The provisioning script uses `curl | sh` for NodeSource and Tailscale for convenience. For stricter environments, consider using the official APT repositories with GPG signature verification instead. Each provider documents this approach: [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1187/install-ubuntu-2204). Incus is installed directly from the [Zabbly APT repository](https://github.com/zabbly/incus) with proper GPG verification.
